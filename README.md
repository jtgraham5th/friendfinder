# friendfinder

## Overview
In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.Express is being used to handle routing and the app has been deployed to heroku. You can test it out here: https://guarded-island-96299.herokuapp.com

## Purpose
This project helped me learn how to: 
* Configure an Express.js app to handle GET and POST requests
* Configure an Express.js app to serve static files
* Identify how client-side requests relate to server-side responses
* Parse optional and required parameters when creating server-side routes
* Implement client-side POST requests to submit form data to a server
* Explain and configure middleware to extend the functionality of Express.js

## Maintenance and Contact
I maintain this project and if you have any questions, comments or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.
